# PIZ

Posgresql for zig!

## How to run?

This project contains is executable and you can run it using the command below:

```sh
task run
```

for `task` go to [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) and for sure you need a running database which details that are obvious I guess :-D

## And?

And nothing for now I guess, just experimenting and probably horribly coded (I am not a `zig` programmer).

I want to learn zig and wrrite library that might be useful for me or others in the future.
